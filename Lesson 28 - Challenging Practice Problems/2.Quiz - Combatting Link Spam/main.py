# Two Gold Stars
# Question 2: Combatting Link Spam

# One of the problems with our page ranking system is pages can 
# collude with each other to improve their page ranks.  We consider 
# A->B a reciprocal link if there is a link path from B to A of length 
# equal to or below the collusion level, k.  The length of a link path 
# is the number of links which are taken to travel from one page to the 
# other.

# If k = 0, then a link from A to A is a reciprocal link for node A, 
# since no links needs to be taken to get from A to A.

# If k=1, B->A would count as a reciprocal link  if there is a link 
# A->B, which includes one link and so is of length 1. (it requires 
# two parties, A and B, to collude to increase each others page rank).

# If k=2, B->A would count as a reciprocal link for node A if there is
# a path A->C->B, for some page C, (link path of length 2),
# or a direct link A-> B (link path of length 1).

# Modify the compute_ranks code to 
#   - take an extra input k, which is a non-negative integer, and 
#   - exclude reciprocal links of length up to and including k from 
#     helping the page rank.
