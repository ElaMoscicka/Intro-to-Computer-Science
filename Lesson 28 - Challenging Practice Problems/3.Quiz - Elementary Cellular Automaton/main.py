# THREE GOLD STARS
# Question 3-star: Elementary Cellular Automaton

# Please see the video for additional explanation.

# A one-dimensional cellular automata takes in a string, which in our 
# case, consists of the characters '.' and 'x', and changes it according 
# to some predetermined rules. The rules consider three characters, which 
# are a character at position k and its two neighbours, and determine 
# what the character at the corresponding position k will be in the new 
# string.

# For example, if the character at position k in the string  is '.' and 
# its neighbours are '.' and 'x', then the pattern is '..x'. We look up 
# '..x' in the table below. In the table, '..x' corresponds to 'x' which 
# means that in the new string, 'x' will be at position k.

# Rules:
#          pattern in         position k in        contribution to
# Value    current string     new string           pattern number
#                                                  is 0 if replaced by '.'
#                                                  and value if replaced
#                                                  by 'x'
#   1       '...'               '.'                        1 * 0
#   2       '..x'               'x'                        2 * 1
#   4       '.x.'               'x'                        4 * 1
#   8       '.xx'               'x'                        8 * 1
#  16       'x..'               '.'                       16 * 0
#  32       'x.x'               '.'                       32 * 0
#  64       'xx.'               '.'                       64 * 0
# 128       'xxx'               'x'                      128 * 1
#                                                      ----------
#                                                           142

# To calculate the patterns which will have the central character x, work 
# out the values required to sum to the pattern number. For example,
# 32 = 32 so only pattern 32 which is x.x changes the central position to
# an x. All the others have a . in the next line.

# 23 = 16 + 4 + 2 + 1 which means that 'x..', '.x.', '..x' and '...' all 
# lead to an 'x' in the next line and the rest have a '.'

# For pattern 142, and starting string
# ...........x...........
# the new strings created will be
# ..........xx...........  (generations = 1)
# .........xx............  (generations = 2)
# ........xx.............  (generations = 3)
# .......xx..............  (generations = 4)
# ......xx...............  (generations = 5)
# .....xx................  (generations = 6)
# ....xx.................  (generations = 7)
# ...xx..................  (generations = 8)
# ..xx...................  (generations = 9)
# .xx....................  (generations = 10)

# Note that the first position of the string is next to the last position 
# in the string.

# Define a procedure, cellular_automaton, that takes three inputs: 
#     a non-empty string, 
#     a pattern number which is an integer between 0 and 255 that
# represents a set of rules, and 
#     a positive integer, n, which is the number of generations. 
# The procedure should return a string which is the result of
# applying the rules generated by the pattern to the string n times.

    patterns = {} #empty dictionary
    pattern_list = ['...', '..x', '.x.', '.xx', 'x..', 'x.x', 'xx.', 'xxx'] #all patterns we can refer to
    n = len(string)
    
    #build my patterns dictionary
    for i in range(7, -1, -1): #looping through the numbers 7 to 0 in reverse order
        if pattern_number/(2**i) == 1: #checking if pattern number is divisible by 2 to the power of that number
            patterns[pattern_list[i]] = 'x'
            pattern_number = pattern_number - 2**i #if it's equal to 1, substracting power from the pattern number
        else: #if it's equal to 0, then the corresponding valuse is '.' insted of 'x'
            patterns[pattern_list[i]] = '.'
           
            
    #make a new string by applying pattern to string
    #generations
    for j in range(0, generations):
        new_string = ''
        for i in range(0, n): #loop through the old string or through the indexes in the old string
        #building pattern: central char we're looking at + it's the neighbour the left and the neighbour to the right
        #using modulo n
            pattern = string[i - 1]  + string[i] + string[(i + 1)%n] 
            new_string = new_string + patterns[pattern]
        string = new_string
    return new_string
